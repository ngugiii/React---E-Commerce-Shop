# A REACT ecommerce project

This is a fully functional E-commerce project that is currently under developement. It is an upgrade to an E-commerce project that I previously developed using plain Vanilla JavaScript. Currently I am done with authentication where I used Redux and firebase and I am currenyly dealing with the cart and checkout functionality before I finally use firestore to store my products.
