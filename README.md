# A React E-commerce Website

This is a fully functional E-commerce website that is currently under developement. It is an upgrade to an E-commerce project that I previously developed using Vanilla JavaScript. Currently I am done with authentication where I used Redux and firebase and the cart and checkout functionality using Context API.
